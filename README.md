# NetworkingLite

A fully functional networking library written with Foundation in less than 70 lines of code with Swift 5.1 and SPM.

## Inspiration

How many times a year have you needed to setup basic networking in project or POC, but ended up writing the same basic networking classes over and over again?  

Inspired by frameworks such as Alamofire and Moya, I wanted an example showing that 3rd party Networking dependencies are not necessary with the latest version of Swift. It is much easier to create your own, and customize it without add thousands of lines of unneeded dependencies.
